Definition and Importance of ORM
Online Reputation Management (ORM) involves actively monitoring,
analyzing, and influencing an individual’s or brand’s reputation across
digital platforms and public online domains. ORM encompasses a range of
activities, such as review management, social listening, public relations,
search engine optimization (SEO), and proactive engagement to ensure
positive perception and mitigate risks from negative exposure. ORM is
essential in digital marketing, as over 98% of consumers now seek online
reviews before making purchase decisions, with the average buyer filtering
out brands below a 4-star rating. A strong online reputation increases
consumer trust, drives conversions, and builds long-term brand loyalty.
Brand Selection and Justification
MuscleBlaze was chosen because of its distinct leadership in the Indian
sports nutrition market, innovation in transparency (lab certifications, QR
checks), and its frequent scrutiny across highly active online fitness
communities. MuscleBlaze’s robust digital campaigns, customer
engagement on social media, and challenges with third-party review
platforms make it an ideal candidate for a detailed ORM case study.
